1. Before coming to Max Technical Training I was a bilingual project coordinator at Apex Supply Chain Technologies. 
I was there for 2 years and dealt with new customers and repeat customers new orders. I conducted software training,
installation readiness calls, and helped my customers use their application to the fullest extent. 

2. I chose a bootcamp route because I need to make myself more marketable for jobs. I enjoyed my job at Apex but there
was no clear career path. I have always wanted to try coding and it is a job market that is not going anywhere anytime
soon. I chose MAX specfically because I had a friend come through this camp last year and he loved it and now has a
great job.

3. Based off of day 1, this bootcamp is going to be challenging. Thre is going to be a whole lot of information given in
very rapid succession and it is up to me to practice outside of class to grasp these concepts. There will be a lot of at home 
practice and study to make sure I can learn and retain the information.
